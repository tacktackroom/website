Their biggest differentiating factor from western saddles (the other type of saddle) is that they have a much smaller tree, which creates the structure of the saddle and helps create the space under the saddle for the spine, in which two panels sit either side of. In an English saddle, trees are small and have no horn, which is the “handle” at the front of the saddle. The English saddle as we know it today originated in England in the 18 th &nbsp;century, as foxhunting became more popular and horse and rider were required to be more athletic and tackle ditches, hedges, walls, and fences. Traditionally, saddles used for long-distance travel and work had high pommels and cantles, but this style of saddle is too restrictive for fast work and jumping. Modern English saddles have evolved significantly, especially in the last three decades or so as technology has advanced and competitive riding has become more accessible. There are now numerous styles and iterations of each type of English saddle, these are: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jumper/hunter – a forward cut saddle designed for jumpers and hunters &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event – an extremely forward cut saddle with a flat seat used exclusively for the cross-country section of an eventing competition &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dressage – a straight cut saddle with a relatively deep seat, designed to secure the rider’s leg “behind” the horse’s shoulder &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All purpose or general purpose – similar to jumper/hunter saddles but slightly less forward cut and usually made with comfort in mind over performance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Horse racing – incredibly flat saddle with very little structure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Polo – polo saddles have very flat flaps so the riders can move their legs freely &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sidesaddle – the old-fashioned style of women’s saddle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Endurance – endurance saddles come in both English and western styles The fit of English saddles depends on the shape of the tree, the width of the gullet, the cut of the saddle over or behind the shoulder, and the seat size. Girths typically do up under the saddle flap (under the leg) on jumper and general-purpose saddles, though sometimes they have billets (the leather straps the girth does up to) like those on dressage and eventing saddles, where the billets are long so the girth does up lower down, typically near the rider’s ankle. When the saddle fits the horse correctly you need very little extra equipment to use one, though there are plenty of options if you want to adjust the fit slightly or add some extra security. To use an English saddle all you need is a girth, stirrup leathers, and stirrups, and a saddle pad is used at all times other than for some showing classes, to give the saddle more grip, wick away sweat, and provide some extra cushioning for the horse. Other equipment you may see used are half-pads under the saddle and breastplates to prevent the saddle from slipping back."> <span>Saddle</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/14-tack" title=""> <span>Tack</span> </a><ul><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/45-bridle-co" title=""> <span>Bridle &amp; Co</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/24-training-aids" title="Over the years numerous training aids have been developed to help riders a higher level of control, improve their horses’ way of going, improve performance, and give their horses more obvious signals about what is being asked of them."> <span>Training Aids</span> </a></li><li class="last"> <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/44-saddle-equipment" title="All saddles require extra equipment to keep them secure, keep the rider secure, in the best condition, and provide the best level of comfort for the horse."> <span>Saddle Equipment</span> </a></li></ul></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/43-horse-clothing" title="While horses that live out and aren’t in work can generally be left without blankets and other accessories, as soon as we get extreme weather or you ask your horse to do more than just eat in a field, you need to think about extra apparel for them.

Bell boots (sometimes called overreach boots) will prevent your horse from getting cuts on the bulbs of their front feet if their own back feet scrape them.

For more casual shows and training shows, it may be appropriate to wear a polo shirt without a jacket, but always check the rules and don’t assume that a polo shirt alone is okay. For hunter classes, you can be a little more creative with your outfit, opting for a brown jacket and a pastel-colored shirt, though of course black and green jackets with white shirts are always a good look. Jackets for hunter classes are typically longer, reaching mid-upper thigh. For show jumping, especially at higher levels, your jacket will typically be short, fitted, and black, or navy, though the higher the level you compete the more colorful a jacket you can get away with. If you are competing in a dressage competition your jacket should be tweed, black, or navy, and are often longer than those seen in hunter and jumper rings. Western jackets, when appropriate, are often fairly flashy, with embellishments and metallic accents. For many western competitions, however, a jacket is not needed, so follow the guidelines of the show."> <span>Show Jacket</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/88-polo-shirt" title=""> <span>Polo &amp; Shirt</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/89-show-pants-breeches" title="Show pants are generally the same across the board, so you can have just a pair or two of show pants for competitions and wear them for any class. Choose a color you are comfortable in and consider wearing a pair of loose pants over your breeches until you are ready to get on to keep them clean. For hunters and jumpers, opt for neutral colors over stark white, such as tan, olive, fawn, brown, stone, or any other variation. You should pair your breeches with a belt. Showjumpers typically wear white or off-white colored pants, though any neutral color is correct. If you are competing in dressage white breeches are ideal, provided you can keep them clean enough until you’re on the horse, otherwise any pale neutral color is appropriate. For those riding western, chaps are typically worn over your pants, and pants can be any shade of black, white, grey, or blue. Dark wash jeans may also be appropriate, but it’s worth checking with the requirements of your class, as western-style competitions range from fairly formal to very casual, depending on the discipline."> <span>Show Pants - Breeches</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/90-accessories" title=""> <span>Accessories</span> </a></li><li class="last"> <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/111-tie" title=""> <span>Tie</span> </a></li></ul></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/76-boot" title=""> <span>Boot</span> </a><ul><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/77-paddock-boots" title=""> <span>Paddock Boots</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/78-half-chaps" title=""> <span>Half Chaps</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/79-tall-boots" title=""> <span>Tall Boots</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/112-socks" title=""> <span>Socks</span> </a></li><li class="last"> <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/113-accessory-for-horse-rider-boots" title=""> <span>Accessory for horse rider boots</span> </a></li></ul></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/80-rider-protection" title=""> <span>Rider Protection</span> </a><ul><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/91-helmet" title=""> <span>Helmet</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/92-bag-protection-airbag" title=""> <span>Bag Protection / Airbag</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/116-accessories" title=""> <span>Accessories</span> </a></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/117-helmet-visor" title=""> <span>Helmet visor</span> </a></li><li class="last"> <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/163-vest" title=""> <span>Vest</span> </a></li></ul></li><li > <a href="http://127.0.0.1/ttr/85-spurs-crop" title=""> <span>Spurs &amp;
